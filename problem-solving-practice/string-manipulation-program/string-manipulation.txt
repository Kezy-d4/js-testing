Interface:
The program will operate within the browser console. The user will interact with a pop-up dialog box. 

Inputs:
The user will input any string into the input field of a dialog box.

//
Desired output:
A series of console logs based on the users inputted string: The first log should print the users string in full. If the users string is greater than one character in length, each subsequent log should print a new string based on the previously logged string, except with one character subtracted from the end of said previously logged string. This process should repeat until a string containing only one character — the first character of the users original string — is logged to the console.
