Interface:
The program will operate within the browser console. The user will interact with a pop-up dialog box. 

Inputs:
The user will input any string into the input field of a dialog box.

Desired output:
A series of console logs based on the users inputted string: The first log should print the users string in full. If the users string is greater than one character in length, each subsequent log should print a new string based on the previously logged string, except with one character subtracted from the end of said previously logged string. This process should repeat until a string containing only one character — the first character of the users original string — is logged to the console. 

Pseudo-Code:
Initialize variable: userString of data type: string
Prompt user to enter any string
Assign value of prompt to userString

When user proceeds with empty input or cancels
  Ask user to enter a string
When user proceeds with valid input
  Print value of userString to console

Get character length of userString
When character length of userString is greater than one
Initialize variable: manipulatedString of data type: string
Assign value of userString to manipulatedString

While character length of manipulatedString is greater than one
  Get substring of manipulatedString with one character subtracted from the end
  Assign value of said substring to manipulatedString
  Print value of manipulatedString to console
